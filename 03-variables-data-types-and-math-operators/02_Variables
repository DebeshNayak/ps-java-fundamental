** Variables:
- Named data storage
- Strongly typed
------
int dataValue;
dataValue = 100;
------
int myInfo = 200;
------
- Value can be modified

** Naming Variables
- Variable naming is based on a combination of rules and conventions
    - Rules allow the use of letters, numbers, $ and _
        - By convention only letters and numbers are used 
    - Rules require that first character is not a numbers   
        - By convention it is always a letter 
    - By convention follow the style often referred to as "Camel Case"
        - First letter is lower case 
        - Start of each word after the first is upper case 
        - All other letters are lower case 

- Valid variable example:
------
int total;
int grade4;
int bankAccountBalance;
int level2Training;
------
** Using Variables:
------
public class main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int myVar;
        // System.out.println(myVar); // Error - Local variable doesn't get a value, becasue there is no value define inside of them
        
        myVar = 50;
        System.out.println(myVar); // Output: 50

        int anotherVar = 100;
        System.out.println(anotherVar); // Output: 100

        myVar = anotherVar;
        System.out.println(myVar);  // Output: 100

        anotherVar = 200;
        System.out.println(anotherVar); // Output: 200

        System.out.println(myVar); // Output: 100
    }
}
