- Primitive types
    - Integer types, floating point types, char type, boolean type 
- Math operators
    - Basic operators, postfix/prefix operators, compound assignment operators 
- Math operators follow a well-defined order of precedence 
- Type conversions 
    - Compiler can automatically apply widening type conversions 
    - Use type casting to explicitly perform type conversions
