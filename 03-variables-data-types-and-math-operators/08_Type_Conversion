Type Conversion:
---------------
Implicit type conversion:
- Conversions performed automatically by the compiler
---------------
int iVal = 50;
long lVal = iVal;
---------------
Explicit type conversion:
- Conversion performed explicitly in code with cast operator
-------
long lVal = 50;
int iVal = (int) lVal; 
-------
Implicit Type Conversion:
- Widening conversions are automatic 
- Mixed integer sizes 
    - uses largest integer in equation 
- Mixed floating point sizes 
    - Uses double 
- Mixed integer and floating point 
    - Uses largest floating point in equation 
-------
Explicit Type Conversion:
- Can performing widening and narrowing 
- Floating point to integer drops fraction 
- Use caution with narrowing conversions 
- Integer to floating point can lose precision
